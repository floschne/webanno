The arrow buttons *first page*, *next page*, *previous page*, *last page*, and *go to page* allow you to navigate accordingly. The *Prev.* and *Next* buttons in the *Document* frame allow you to go to the previous or next document on your project list.

Annotation of spans works by selecting the span, or double-clicking on a word. This activates the *Actions*-box on the right, where you can choose a layer. One can also type in the initial letters and chose the needed layer. After having chosen a layer, the drop-down menu inside the *Features*-box displays the features you can use during the annotation. The tag can be selected out of the drop-down menu inside the *Features*-box which contains the tags of the chosen layer.

To change or delete an annotation, double-click on the annotation (span or link annotations). The *Actions*-box is now activated. Changes and Deletions are possible via the respective buttons. 

Link annotations (between POS tags) are created by selecting the starting POS-tag, then dragging the arrow to connect it to its target POS tag. All possible targets are highlighted.
