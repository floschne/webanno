= Getting started

In order to run {product-name}, you need to have Java installed on your system in version 8 or 
higher. If you do not have Java installed yet, please the latest link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle Java] or link:https://adoptopenjdk.net[OpenJDK].

Download the stand-alone JAR from the link:https://webanno.github.io/webanno/downloads/[WebAnno downloads page]. 

Start the application simply by *double-clicking* on the download JAR file in your file manager.
After a moment, a splash screen will be displayed while the application is initializing. Once the
initialization is complete, a dialog will appear which you can use to open the application in your
default browser or to shut down the application.

Alternatively, you can start it on the command line using

[subs="+attributes"]
----
$ java -jar webanno-{revnumber}.standalone.jar
----

The splash screen and dialog will not appear in this case and you have to manually point your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

The first time you start the application, a default user with the name `admin` and the password
`admin` is created. Use this username and password to log in to the application after opening it
in your browser.

== Your first annotation

After logging in, you will see the main menu. Click on *Projects* to go to the 
*project management page* and there click on *create* to start a new project. Enter a name
for your project, select the type *annotation project* and press *save*.

Next, switch to the *Documents* tab and press *choose files* to select a plain text file from
your local harddisk (the file should be in UTF-8 encoding). As part of the import process, 
{product-name} automatically processes the file to identify sentence and token boundaries.

Use the *Home* link at the top of the screen to return to the main menu and select *Annotation*
to open your text file in the annotation editor.

To create your first annotation, select *Named entity* from the *Layer* dropdown menu on the right
side of the screen. Then, use the mouse to select a word in the *Annotation* area. When you release
the mouse button, the annotation is immediately created and you can edit its details in the right
sidebar.

Congratulations! You have created your first annotation project.

== Where to go from here

To familiarize yourself with the functionalities of {product-name}, try importing some of the link:https://webanno.github.io/webanno/downloads/[WebAnno downloads page][example projects]. 

Running {product-name} in the way you just did is a great way to get started and try out its
capabilities, but it is not the best way of working with the application. If you like 
{product-name},  please be sure to check out the <<admin-guide.adoc,Administrator Guide>> to 
learn how to set up a production-ready instance.

[NOTE]
====
By default, WebAnno creates and uses an embedded database and stores all its data in  folder called `.webanno` (_dot webanno_) within your home folder. While this allows you to get started very quickly in trying out the application, it is not a recommended configuration for serious use. For production use, please configure WebAnno to use a database server when using it in production. For more information, please refer to the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_database,Administrator Guide>>.
====

[NOTE]
====
By default the server starts on port 8080 and you can access it via a browser at `http://localhost:8080` after you started it. But if you already have a service running on that port, you can add the parameter `-Dserver.port=9999` at the end of the command line to start the server on port 9999 (or choose any other port).
