= Upgrading with separate Tomcat

* While Tomcat is running, delete the old WAR from your `webapps` folder
* Wait until Tomcat has automatically deleted the WebAnno folder 
* Stop Tomcat
* Place the new WAR file into your `webapps` folder
* Start Tomcat

== Upgrading Tomcat 7 to Tomcat 8

If you have been using our installation instructions to install WebAnno on Linux, you are probably
running an instance of Tomcat 6. WebAnno 3.3.0 is no longer compatible with Tomcat 6 and requires
at least Tomcat 8. 

To upgrade your existing instance, you can try the following procedure (adapt the procedure as
necessary if you have deviated from our installation instructions):

    * Stop the current WebAnno Tomcat 7 instance
----
$ service webanno stop
----
    * Move your old Tomcat instance out of the way
----
$ mv /opt/webanno /opt/webanno-tomcat7
----
    * Install `tomcat8-user` package (this will automatically uninstall Tomcat 7)
----
$ apt-get install tomcat8-user
----
   * Create new instance
----
$ cd /opt
$ tomcat8-instance-create -p 18080 -c 18005 webanno
$ chown -R www-data /opt/webanno
----
  * Copy the WAR file over to the new instance
----
$ mv /opt/webanno-tomcat7/webapps/webanno.war /opt/webanno/webapps/webanno.war
----
    * Stop the new WebAnno Tomcat 8 instance
----
$ service webanno start
----
  
NOTE: If you have made additional changes to the Tomcat 7 configuration files, e.g. changed
      `conf/server.xml`, please make sure to redo them in the new Tomcat 8 instance.
