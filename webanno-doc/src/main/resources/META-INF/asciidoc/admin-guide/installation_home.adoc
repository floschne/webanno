= Application home folder

The {product-name} home folder is the place where {product-name}'s configuration file `settings.properties`
resides and where {product-name} stores its data. Mind that if you are using a MySQL database server
(recommended), then {product-name} also stores some data in the MySQL database. This is important when
you plan to perform a backup, as both the home folder and the database content need to be
included in the backup.

Now, let's go through the steps of setting up a home folder for {product-name} and creating a
configuration file instructing {product-name} to access the previously prepared MySQL database.

* Create {product-name} home folder. This is the directory where {product-name} settings files and projects (documents, annotations, etc.) are stored
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir /srv/webanno
----
////
// FIXME How to reference to sample data?
* *Optional* If you want to test {product-name} with some sample data, skip the _Users and permissions_ section and follow the instruction at [Sampledata], then come back here.
////
* Edit `/srv/webanno/settings.properties` to define the database connection as well as internal backup properties:
+
[source,text]
----
database.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
database.driver=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/webanno?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
database.username=webanno
database.password=t0t4llYSecreT

# 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 = 30 days
backup.keep.time=2592000

# 60 * 5 = 5 minutes
backup.interval=300

backup.keep.number=10
----
+
* Fix permissions in {product-name} home folder
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chown -R www-data /srv/webanno
